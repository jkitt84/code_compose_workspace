 * Main Function
 *
 * The main function is the entry point of a C program. When a C program
 * starts running, the code in main is the first code to be executed.
 *
 * This code will be relying on interrupts to perform actions, so, the main
 * function will only be executed once.
 *
 * The code in the main function will perform configuration actions such as:
 * 			* configuring the clock system,
 * 			* setting up the interrupts,
 * 			* configuring the input and output ports, and
 * 			* initializing the sleep mode.
 * 	At the end of the main function the microcontroller will go to sleep.
 * 	After the uC goes to sleep, it will only execute the code in the
 * 	Timer A interrupt service routine below when the Timer goes off.

	// EXAMPLES OF WHAT MIGHT APPEAR IN YOUR CODE:

	// Some commands to write to Ports that have been configured as outputs:
	//P1OUT=255;        // Sets all pins of Port1 to 1
	//P1OUT=0;          // Sets all pins of Port1 to 0
	//P1OUT=128+32;     // Sets P1.7 and P1.5 to 1; all other Port1 pins to 0
	//P1OUT=160;        // Same as above, but uses 128+32=160 on the RHS
	//P1OUT=0xA0;       // Same as above, but uses hex notation on the RHS
	//P2OUT=128;        // Sets XOUT pin to 1, XIN pin to 0
	//P2OUT=64;         // Sets XIN  pin to 1, XOUT pin to 0
	//P2OUT=0;          // Sets XIN and XOUT to 0

	// Some commands to read from a port that has been configured as input
	n=P1IN;     // Sets n to a number between 0 and 255 depending on the
	            // high or low state of the individual pins of Port 1
	            // Example: n will be read in as 128+32+1 = 161 if
	            // the voltages applied to Port1 = [1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1]
	            // Remember that 1=high=(3.3V) and 0=low=(0 V)

	            // k=128+64=192 if both are high

	// After reading from an input port, the values read can be tested. For
	// example:
	//
	// if ( k == (128 + 64) ) {
	// 		// if both XIN and XOUT are 1s, execute code in this block
	// 		code
	// 		code
